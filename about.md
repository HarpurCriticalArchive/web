## Aï»¿About the Charles Harpur Critical Archive

The Charles Harpur Critical Archive (CHCA) is a digital archive and a 
scholarly edition of the poetic works of Charles Harpur (1813--68), the 
most significant poet of colonial New South Wales. A Romantic celebrator 
of Australian landscape, a political satirist, a love poet and early 
environmentalist, Harpur and his works remain relevant today. But they 
are not easily accessible.

This is because Harpur was a prolific poet and an inveterate reviser. 
Extant today in manuscript, and in colonial newspaper and other printed 
forms, are over 2,700 versions of his 686 works in verse, as well as the 
often fascinating prose notes that he wrote for them. Most of these 
versions have never been published. For decades, those that achieved 
printed book form were misrepresented because of the efforts of an 
interventionist early editor of his posthumous Poems (1883), which 
became the source of the reprintings.

Published by Sydney University Press and supported by an innovative 
technical underpinning, the CHCA aims to set this situation to rights.
