__selection of harpur mss at the mitchell library__

The archival transcriptions of Harpurâ€™s poems in the CHCA, on which the edited reading texts are based, are sourced mainly from colonial newspapers and the substantial collection of his manuscript books in the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney. Images of individual pages were obtained from the Library and then processed to represent openings in the source volumes. Press VIEW to leaf through each volume.
