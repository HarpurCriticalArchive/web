<h3 id="anameperapermissions"><a name=PER></a>Permissions</h3>

<p>Digital images of the bulk of the manuscript and pictorial material published in the CHCA were sourced from the holder of the originals: Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney. The Library’s permission to publish the material is gratefully acknowledged. This permission extends beyond materials produced by Charles Harpur to images of his two-way correspondence with contemporaries. Correspondence in other libraries has been included, and the co-operation of the State Library of Victoria and Trinity College, University of Melbourne is gratefully recorded. <a href="#FN1">(1)</a></p>

<p>Copies of the image and checked transcription files are preserved by Sydney University Library, of which Sydney University Press, publisher of the CHCA, is a division. Other project files (edited reading texts, commentary, contributions of collaborators) will similarly be preserved as successive stages of publication are reached.</p>

<p>Efforts have been made, without success, to ascertain the existence of other rights holders of nineteenth-century materials in order to seek their permission to publish. Given the intervening decades the lack of success is unsurprising. Nevertheless, should any rights holders emerge and request that their in-copyright materials be taken down, their wishes will be respected. Application should be made to Sydney University Press.</p>

<p>Images of many of the Harpur poems published in newspapers have been sourced from <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au">TROVE</a>. They are reproduced courtesy of the National Library of Australia.</p>

<h3 id="anamerigarights"><a name=RIG></a>Rights</h3>

<p>Users of the CHCA wishing to reproduce images published in it are advised to go back to the source: that is, approach the owners or holders of the original materials and seek permission of them. </p>

<p>The texts of the versions of Charles Harpur’s works published in his lifetime are out of copyright. The new transcriptions of them provided in the CHCA may be freely copied subject only to the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence. <a href="#FN2">(2)</a></p>

<p>The newly edited reading texts of each version, and the commentary, metadata and other editorial materials published in the Charles Harpur Critical Archive are copyright © 2015 Paul Eggert. Other materials within the Charles Harpur Critical Archive that are dated and signed by their contributors (for example, annotations) are, in each case, copyright © the named contributor, from the date given. Sydney University Press as publisher should be approached for permission to reproduce textual and other materials over which copyright is claimed. Permission will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>The open-source <a href="http://www.austese.net">AustESE scholarly editing platform</a> used for the CHCA was developed during 2012–13 at Jane Hunter’s eResearch lab in the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland under an Australian federal government NeCTAR (National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources) grant in its eResearch Tools program. Hunter and Paul Eggert were co-CIs on the AustESE project. Managed by Wilfred Brimblecombe, it aimed to develop a set of interoperable services to support the production of electronic scholarly editions by distributed collaborators in a Web 2.0 environment. Anna Gerber was the principal software engineer. Roger Osborne advised on the ontology and conceptual design. </p>

<p>As tested for the suite of AustESE tools and workflow, and as extended and adapted technically during 2014–16, the CHCA will, it is hoped, serve as a forerunner to other editorial projects. For that reason, all adaptations of AustESE tools, workflow and design for the purposes of the CHCA are likewise open-source. The design and programming of the public-facing ‘front-end’ site of the CHCA is by Desmond Schmidt. The design and programming of the production ‘back-end’ site is by Anna Gerber, Desmond Schmidt and Damien Ayers. Schmidt has been responsible for technical design and adaptation work during 2014–16.</p>

<h3 id="anameaknaacknowledgements"><a name=AKN></a>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>The Australian Research Council (ARC) is thanked for the Discovery Grant and professorial fellowship for 2009–14 awarded to Paul Eggert; the combination made the CHCA feasible. Eggert’s co-‘Chief Investigator’ (for ARC purposes) was Elizabeth Webby. Similarly, the overseas ‘Partner Investigator’ was Peter Robinson; his valuable advice in the early stages of the project was much appreciated. </p>

<p>The University of New South Wales, Canberra and its School of Humanities and Social Sciences where Eggert was based until the end of 2014 supported the project in large ways and small, the latter too numerous to specify. Katherine Barnes, Tessa Wooldridge and Jane Rankine rendered valuable research assistance at different times, and Kent Fitch lent welcome technical advice.</p>

<p>From 2015 funding for the project has come from the Martin J. Svaglic Chair in Textual Studies at Loyola University, Chicago.</p>

<p>Sydney University Press is the publisher of the CHCA. At the University of Sydney Ross Coleman (until the end of 2014, Director of the Library’s Collection, Digital and eScholarship Services) deserves special thanks for his far-sighted appreciation of the prospects of digital literary scholarship. The director of Sydney University Press, Susan Murray-Smith, similarly deserves recognition for her preparedness to experiment with new forms of scholarly publication such as the CHCA and its future derivative publications. At the same university and for their technical assistance, experimentation and advice, Creagh Cole, Sten Christensen, Steven Hayes, Ian Johnson and James Watson are also thanked. Also deserving thanks are independent researchers Carol Hetherington and Perry Middlemiss; at the National Library of Australia Cathy Pilgrim and Margy Burn; and, at the Mitchell Library, Richard Neville, Maggie Patton, Robyn Hayward and, for his staunch support, Paul Brunton.</p>

<p>Kerry Kilner and Jonathan Hadwen’s co-operation in achieving a linking of the bibliographic-search capacity within the AustLit database with the texts within the CHCA is appreciated. The subject index in the CHCA was adapted from AustLit records. The ongoing assistance lent by IT staff at Loyola University, Chicago (in whose English Department Eggert is based from 2015) in the further development of the project is gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>Dibyajyoti Ghosh and Sunayani Bhattacharya, Masters students at the time in the School of Cultural Records, Jadavpur University, Kolkata were employed to produce an initial draft transcription from images of the Harpur manuscript books. Their supervisor, Sukanta Chaudhuri, is thanked for welcoming and supervising this arrangement. Working in Melbourne, Meredith Sherlock was employed to check these drafts, correct the XML encoding, including dividing the files into work versions for processing by Desmond Schmidt and Anna Gerber. Sherlock also input the many hundreds of texts taken from newspapers, broadsheets and published anthologies; and she proofread against the Monash University Library copy the originally scanned texts of Poems (1883) taken from the <a href="http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozedits/harpur">SETIS site</a> (University of Sydney Library), and similarly those in <em>The Bushrangers: A Play in Five Acts, and Other Poems</em> (1853).</p>

<p>Sherlock was also the project’s digital archivist during 2009–15. In order to maintain bibliographical control of the thousands of Harpur versions and facsimile images she redesigned the database created from the Holt and Perkins <em>Finding List</em> to reflect the archival and editorial principles being employed in the CHCA: see further, <a href="10">Structural Reworkings of the Finding List</a>.</p>

<p>During this same period Paul Eggert managed the development and workflow of the CHCA. As Editor, he is giving a final check to the transcriptions, establishing an edited text of each significant version, writing a textual history of each work and providing detailed commentary on the textual cruxes encountered within versions.</p>

<p>Eggert’s work as editor remains ongoing, as does Elizabeth Webby’s. She is contributing annotation of a historical, linguistic and literary-historical kind. We seek other collaborators. Their contributions will be date-stamped and signed. Those that are officially published by the project are guaranteed to be archived at the University of Sydney Library, along with the rest of the project’s archival files. It is envisaged that, as new collaborators build up bodies of annotation, formal publication events will occur that recognise these contributions. Peer reviewing will be provided. Intending collaborators should contact Paul Eggert, Martin J. Svaglic Chair in Textual Studies, English Department, Loyola University, Chicago (peggert@luc.edu).</p>
