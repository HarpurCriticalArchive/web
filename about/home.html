<p>The CHCA is a digital archive <em>and</em> a
scholarly edition of the poetic works of Charles Harpur (1813&#8211;68), the
most important poet of colonial New South Wales. A Romantic celebrator
of Australian landscape, a political satirist, a love poet and early
environmentalist, Harpur and his works remain relevant today. But they
are not easily accessible.<br/>
This is because Harpur was a prolific poet and an inveterate reviser.
Extant today in manuscript, and in colonial newspaper and other printed
forms, are over 2,700 versions of his 686 works in verse, as well as the
often fascinating prose notes that he wrote for them. Most of these
versions have never been published - until now.</p>
