<h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>The Charles Harpur Critical Archive (CHCA) is a digital archive and a
scholarly edition of the poetic works of Charles Harpur (1813–68).</p>

<h3 id="theeditorialchallenge">The editorial challenge</h3>

<p>Harpur’s verse has been a fairly steady presence in the Australian
cultural scene. However, the efforts of the interventionist early editor
of his posthumous collection <em>Poems</em> (1883) were perpetuated in later
selections and anthologisings. The resulting misrepresentation of his
achievement was not recognised until the 1940s. Efforts were
subsequently made to bring the whole body of his poetic work under
editorial control but these either failed completely or involved
compromises that deprived readers of the full picture.</p>

<p>In part, this was because Harpur was a habitual reviser, and because the papers he left behind at his death
fell into a confusing state over the following decades, as his widow Mary Harpur
sought to secure his legacy. The majority of the 2,700 versions
of his 686 works in verse, together with the notes he wrote for them, have never been published.</p>

<h3 id="archivalandeditorialpolicy">Archival and editorial policy</h3>

<p>To address this situation the CHCA archives the basic materials for an
edition (images and diplomatic transcriptions of the original documents,
both handwritten and printed) and provides edited reading texts,
together with textual commentary and explanatory notation. At first
release in March 2016, the archival responsibility has been
discharged. The editing is ongoing.</p>

<p>The texts are presented, whether in transcription or as edited, at the level of the <em>version</em> rather than the
<em>work</em>. </p>

<p>Via the Browse menu the reader chooses a poem. An archival transcription or edited reading text appears next to an image of the original document. The reader can change the version via a menu at the top. Invoking the Multiway Compare Tool allows the reader to compare changes in the
successive versions of the same work across biographical periods. In addition, the Timeline of compositions allows the reader to identify versions of poems written at roughly the same time and then to choose them, one at a time, via the Browse menu.</p>

<p>A facility
for collaborative contributions to the CHCA by its users is planned. </p>

<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3>

<p>Entries on a biographical Timeline present the main events in Harpur’s
life and milieu. This in turn generates the (separate) Biography, a
series of biographical notes in readable prose, organised year-by-year.
It amplifies events captured more briefly in the biographical Timeline
and provides extra information and materials, including contemporary and
historical photographs, links to images of relevant colonial-newspaper
sources available online, and citations. Another Timeline summarises the
subject matter of each item of Harpur’s surviving correspondence, and a
third records the date (exact or approximate) of all his poetic
compositions and publications, including those that appeared in colonial
newspapers.</p>

<h3 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h3>

<p>The CHCA does not include Harpur’s plays (<em>The Bushrangers</em> and ‘King
Saul’), nor his prose pieces written separately from his poems, although
the technical design of the CHCA will allow them to be incorporated by
collaborating scholars in the future. Nevertheless, all of the often
extensive notes he wrote to accompany the poems are included. As a
result, the CHCA presents rather more Harpur prose (most of it for the
first time) than it does verse. The CHCA takes 1900 as its terminal
date.</p>
