</ul>

<p>Coming to grips with the literary-historical phenomenon that Harpur represents requires a shift in focus and a querying of traditional  assumptions about the shape and manifestation of literary careers. Even had Harpur been successful in placing his Works volume with a book publisher in London (see Biographical Sketch), the colonial back-story would have been its obscured context, in need of later illumination. Oddly, the first major endeavour to recapture Harpur’s works in their entirety did this latter requirement no favours, despite the significance of the editorial achievement and the high difficulty of the endeavour.</p>

<p>In 1984, under Elizabeth Perkins’s editorship, Angus &amp; Robertson in Sydney published <em>The Poetical Works of Charles Harpur</em>, drawn for the first time from the manuscript books and newspapers. It was the first successful attempt to capture at least one version of all of Harpur’s poetry. The volume appeared without textual apparatus or annotation, the poems were not accompanied by Harpur’s notes; and, regrettably because of a publisher’s decision, Perkins’s prepared list of the sources from which the texts were drawn was not included. <a href="#FN1">(1)</a></p>

<p>The imposing 1,000-page volume tended inevitably to isolate Harpur’s works from the colonial contexts from which they arose. The ordering of the contents was not chronological. Rather, it aimed to respect Harpur’s own groupings in those late manuscript books where the poet had in mind the British audience. The stated aim was to allow ‘the unity of his work to emerge’ in this ‘non-definitive, first collected edition’ (p. viii). In the absence of supporting textual commentary and contextual annotation the only way on offer of reading <em>Poetical Works</em> was the traditional aesthetic one, oriented wherever possible around versions from the 1860s deemed to be final.</p>

<p>Clearly, another way is needed if the Harpur encountered by his own, mainly newspaper readers to whom he predominantly addressed his works until late in his life is to be rendered accessible. The approach followed for the CHCA is to respect a broadly chronological principle and editorially to privilege version-texts rather than to establish work-texts on some final-intentions principle. In addition, commentary is supplied on those version-texts as they changed over time in response to changing personal and public circumstances. It was felt that this approach would give the best chance of regathering the lost Harpur while also fully representing the later, better-known one. </p>

<p>The edited reading texts are presented in relation to facsimile images of them drawn from their newspaper printings and manuscript forms, together with textual, historical and other annotation. Checked but unedited transcriptions of each document are also available and must serve as the reader’s point of entry until the corresponding reading texts and editorial matter are finalised and formally published. (They are to be released electronically in tranches.)</p>

<p>This, in sum, is the aim of the CHCA. The flexibility of digital organisation and presentation makes it feasible. This aim would have been impossible to satisfy in book form, short of an extremely expensive half-dozen large volumes of facsimiles, transcriptions and edited texts. Even then the reader would not have enjoyed the advantages of searching, querying or visualising the data in multiple ways, re-organising the content at will and, if desired, contributing insights to the (ongoing) CHCA itself.</p>

<h3><a name=AVE></a>Archival aim versus editorial aim</h3>

<p>Balancing interest in Harpur the newspaper poet against Harpur the author of his unrealised Works volume requires all the evidence to be laid on the table. This is the archival aim of the CHCA. The editorial aim is to provide reading texts of each significant version by intervening editorially between the carrying documents and the needs of a modern readership. The principles and conventions for doing so are outlined in Note on the Transcriptions and Reading Texts. </p>

<p>The scholarly edition, in effect, ‘argues the archive’ in a sustained interpretative gesture. By virtue of its placement within a digital archive of the relevant documents the editing-as-argument opens itself deliberately and explicitly to counter-argument, thus helping to ensure a passage for Charles Harpur’s works into the future – rather than seeking to fix them down definitively once and for all.</p>

<p>Harpur’s prose notes could not be accommodated within Perkins’s edition of Poetical Works even though they are integral to his poetic productions and their address to his readerships. They are included here and treated as part of the version texts. Harpur’s habit of annotating was magnified in its effects, as his fame grew, by the tendency of some newspaper editors to collect several of his poems for simultaneous publication so that, in the 1850s in the <em>People’s Advocate</em> especially, he became, as a poet, virtually a regular columnist with a very identifiable voice.</p>

<p>Spanning as they do the period 1833–68 Harpur’s poems and their notes can be taken to index his sense of a continuously evolving colonial culture. Exposing that indexicality is the broader challenge that the CHCA initiates and seeks collaborators to complete. Whether, as anticipated, that collaboration takes the form of annotation, or of mini- or large-scale essays, the project will attempt to give them a peer-reviewed and permanently archived home. </p>

<p>It is hoped that this digital mode of organising the documentary base, with the interpretative effort in close proximity to it, will give a new burst of life to the study of colonial culture. </p>

<h3><a name=PAH></a>Previous attempts to edit Harpur’s works</h3>

<p>Elizabeth Perkins’s edition of <em>The Poetical Works of Charles Harpur</em> of 1984 came after a couple of earlier, abortive attempts in the 1940s and 1950s to edit the complete poetry. They in turn followed the discovery by the bibliographer and literary historian Cecil W. Salier (1880–1949) – announced in a series of articles published from 1943 – of the importance of the earlier forms of Harpur’s poems in providing authentic sources for their texts. Salier showed that the 1883 collection <em>Poems</em> had put texts into circulation that were seriously misleading not only in comparison with earlier versions published when Harpur was in the prime of manhood but also in comparison with the manuscript books that he prepared in the last couple of years of his life. This 1883 volume had been the trusted source of all selections of Harpur in anthologies hitherto; Salier believed it was time to change tack. <a href="#FN2">(2)</a></p>

<p>The first, and as it turned out only, editorial fruit of Salier’s efforts was the slim volume <em>‘Rosa’: Love Sonnets to Mary Doyle</em> (containing 38 sonnets in 48 pages), published in Melbourne by the London firm Hutchinson and subsidised by the Commonwealth Literary Fund. Soon after Salier’s death in late 1949 the literary academic Guy Howarth, acting for the Commonwealth Literary Fund (CLF), approached the poet, reviewer, public servant and later journalist Muir Holburn (1920–60) to finish Salier’s work. Although the rest of it was unpublished Salier’s remaining work was well advanced. It is not clear whether the size or comprehensiveness of the new volume was a settled thing, but it was to be accompanied by a brief biography. This was June 1950. </p>

<p>A letter from Holburn to Howarth on 28 July 1950 shows his preference: ‘if a selection is to be published which will truly show Harpur in a new light, as a vigorous poet capable of appealing to the present day imagination, a certain amount of his work could profitably be eliminated’.<a href="#FN3">(3)</a> A more considered letter to the secretary of the CLF, H. S. Temby, on 31 July 1955 shows that Salier’s organisation had been or had attempted to be chronological but that Holburn doubted its practicability ‘in the present state of our knowledge’. He proposed instead, in the second letter, ‘a thematic treatment’ even though it would be </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>out of the question if we were contemplating a definitive variorum edition. As I understand it, however, we have in mind a volume with some definite ‘popular’ appeal … [I]n the two chief revisions which Harpur prepared (in 1863 and in 1867/68), the poems were also arranged thematically, even symbolically in some places, so it may be said that the author has given us some authority for the plan which I have proposed. (ibid.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A trained literary critic in the belles-lettristic tradition rather than a scholarly editor or biographer, Holburn invited the schoolteacher and literary and political historian James Normington Rawling (or J. Normington-Rawling as he styled himself for a time) to undertake the short biography that was to accompany the edition. Rawling was the obvious choice since he had received a Commonwealth Literary Fund fellowship in 1947 to write a biography of Harpur. The papers of both men are preserved in the Mitchell Library. </p>

<p>They show that Rawling laboured mightily on the biography manuscript and Holburn on transcribing the poems. This latter job appears to have been undertaken more with a view to writing what would have been his literary-critical introduction to the selection rather than an editorial introduction to the texts and their histories. Holburn would copy out poems or parts of poems, often adding stress marks to sound out their rhythm. He also added comments as he went, some in capital letters. These seem to have been basic thematic markers that he would later index on cards.<a href="#FN4">(4)</a> Their randomness shows the weakness of an unfettered literary-critical approach to his editorial duty. </p>

<p>In comparison, Rawling had the historian’s touch, including a surpassing zeal for documentary comprehensiveness. Unlike Holburn (who was married to the poet and small-press publisher Marjorie Pizer), Rawling did not see himself as a literary man. As he became further immersed in the biographical project, it grew and grew. In 1953 Rawling stated in a letter that the biography was virtually finished at 250,000 words.</p>

<p>Apparently he wanted to complete it first and then draw the briefer version from it for Holburn, reasoning perhaps that he would not know how to summarise a life until he had fully understood it by writing it. In any case, the saga of incompletion went on. His excuses for not finishing-up the relatively brief assignment included the pressure of his work as a schoolteacher and illness. By February 1958 when the extant correspondence breaks off it is not clear that he had actually submitted a finished text. </p>

<p>But Rawling did go on to complete, separately, his full-scale biography of Harpur that was finally published in 1962 by Angus &amp; Robertson in Sydney. An earlier and much longer version of it is also amongst his papers. Rawling had been intending in 1953 to produce a definitive edition of the poems once his biography was published: thus Holburn’s preferred form and Rawling’s might have complemented one another. But as the biography stalled, Rawling was getting older. (He was born in 1898 and would die in 1966). In any case, the edition did not proceed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Holburn had finished his edition. A typescript of an extensive but undated edition, together with Salier’s preceding one dated 1947, are preserved in Holburn’s papers.<a href="#FN5">(5)</a> Neither edition appeared in print, nor does the correspondence explain why. Presumably, either the financial support for what would necessarily have been a very large volume was not available, or the Fund committee grew tired of waiting. If the latter, that may have been because the Fund did not give clear-enough guidelines to begin with: it would scarcely have been in a position to appreciate the nature and intimidating scope of the editorial problem. </p>

<p>The project was in any case superseded in 1963 by a small volume published in Angus &amp; Robertson’s Australian Poets series and edited by Donovan Clarke. Disappointingly, Clarke returned to the texts of 1883, admitting that, although aware of Salier’s arguments, ‘the present editor has been unable to examine the matter fully’ (p. 54).</p>

<p>Thus was promisingly fertile ground tilled – if not harvested – for the editorial labours of others yet to come. There were advances made in two Masters theses that examined some of the Harpur manuscript evidence before Adrian Mitchell’s selection of Harpur’s poems, prose and letters appeared in 1973.<a href="#FN6">(6)</a> </p>

<p>This selection benefited from the new awareness of the manuscript books and in the main drew its texts from them, but without listing the exact sources or providing textual commentary, variant readings or annotation. Mitchell commented that ‘Harpur still remains unknown to us, and will remain so until the manuscripts are collated and the complete works are published’, adding that ‘Much work needs to be done on the dating of the various versions of his poems’ (pp. xxx–xxi). However, the ‘enormously demanding task’ of collating the texts of the versions could not be undertaken for Mitchell’s edition itself. </p>

<p>That left the door open for Perkins but, as mentioned above, she was only able to secure publication of one version of each poem (just as Mitchell had) if now for the entire poetic works, though once again without undertaking the full, detailed survey of the evidence that a textual collation would enforce. Her decision to privilege the final manuscript versions also meant that the principle of organisation was not chronological. </p>

<p>She returned to the task in 1993, beginning then to prepare for a full-scale scholarly edition in two volumes for the Academy Editions of Australian Literature series. The Editorial Board favoured a chronological approach; Perkins herself was unsure.<a href="#FN7">(7)</a> Other projects, then ill health and finally her death in 2005, prevented significant progress. Fortunately however, Perkins together with Elizabeth Holt managed to compile the essential preliminary to a scholarly edition: <em>The Poems of Charles Harpur in Manuscript in the Mitchell Library and in Publication in the Nineteenth Century: An Analytical Finding List</em> (Canberra: Australian Scholarly Editions Centre, 2002). Its identification and dating of versions was a highly significant bibliographical and codicological undertaking. The CHCA has benefited from it, while scrupulously checking and, wherever necessary, superseding its detailed report.<a href="#FN8">(8)</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1987 Perkins had followed up the Poetical Works with an edition of Harpur’s bushranger play in its 1867 version, together with its earliest version ‘The Tragedy of Donohue’, originally part-published in 1835.9 And she would edit a substantial selection of Harpur’s prose notes to his poems in 1998 in a collection published in Sydney by Federation Press: <em>Our First Republicans: John Dunmore Lang, Charles Harpur and Daniel Henry Deniehy,</em> edited by David Headon and Perkins.</p>

<p>Michael Ackland was Perkins’s principal editorial successor. His <em>Charles Harpur: Selected Poetry and Prose</em> (Ringwood, Vic.: Penguin, 1986) offered a shrewdly chosen selection of the poetry and prose, ordered thematically. Their texts were drawn mainly from the manuscript books and retain Harpur’s sometimes idiosyncratic spelling, with a statement of the source in each case. These practices were commendable, and the sacrifice of chronology to content was, for a selection, a sensible way of introducing new readers to Harpur’s works. </p>

<p>Since 1986 no fresh edition of Harpur’s poetry, selected or complete, has appeared, although individual Harpur poems have continued to appear in anthologies, just as they had done since the 1890s. Nor has the long-promised full-scale collation and survey of the textual materials materialised. Making good that gap is the archival aim of the CHCA. The establishment of reading texts of versions, with textual commentary and annotation, accessible chronologically if desired, constitute the editorial aim, now in progress. The chronology of the newspaper versions is precise; that of the manuscript versions is necessarily more approximate but aims to be as reliable as the evidence permits.</p>
