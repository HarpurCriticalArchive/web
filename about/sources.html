<p>The archival transcriptions of Harpur’s poems in the CHCA, on which the edited reading texts are based, are sourced mainly from colonial newspapers and the substantial collection of his manuscript books in the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney.</p>

<h3 id="themanuscriptbooks">The manuscript books</h3>

<p>The descriptions below are adapted from Elizabeth Holt and Elizabeth Perkins, compilers, <a href="http://hass.unsw.adfa.edu.au/ASEC/pdf/HarpurFindingList1.pdf">The Poems of Charles Harpur: An Analytical Finding List (Canberra: Australian Scholarly Editions Centre, 2002)</a>. One manuscript book in the Mitchell’s collection of Harpur materials A98&#8211;2 is not described as out-of-scope: it contains only Cecil Salier’s typed notes on the other manuscript books (probably late 1940s).</p>

(217 poems)<br>
Pages 1–[400]: date 1860–1868. Major part of this volume dates 1867. Some early inserted pages date 1868 and later pages probably 1860 and 1865–1866. Annotations by Mrs Harpur and Washington Harpur, and contents list for most collections by Mrs Harpur were added after Harpur’s death. Pagination is unreliable and some pages are double numbered. <em>Format</em>: Mitchell bound volume containing a number of gatherings of chiefly unlined foolscap pages of thick textured paper with miscellaneous pages and scraps and inserts bound in.</p>

All contents of this volume date 1867, some poems annotated with Harpur’s recollection of date of first (?) version; many poems annotated by Harpur ‘Final Copy’ but later copies and later versions usually exist. ‘Copied into Manuscript(s)’ usually refers to manuscript A87–1. <em>Format</em>: Bound homogenous dark blue paper ruled vertically and horizontally. Some pages cut out. Numbers of excised pages insufficient to account for all poems on Contents List on page 3. The collection to which this Contents list applies has not been located.</p>

<p><img src="/images/about/A96.jpg" alt="A96" />
(66 poems)<br>
Pages 1–74: date 1867. The volume is in Washington Harpur’s writing and transcription is not always reliable. (Washington was aged sixteen in 1867). A96 comprises chiefly ‘Poems in Early Life.’ Some poems extant only from 1850s. Transcription of these poems is sometimes from a very early version and A96 is not a reliable guide for date changes in other versions. [Salier in MS B994 (1946) suggests A96 is ‘a rewritten version of poems, compiled between Feb. 1860 and September 1863, and altered slightly about March 1865.’] However a more likely date for this rewriting is 1867. <em>Format</em>: Foolscap notebook with pale blue paper of 36 lines.</p>

Bound collection of pages compiled from seven gatherings stitched together. Letter to Mitchell Library, dated 1932, enclosing Harpur’s poem ‘Wellington’, as endpaper. Some pages are double numbered with Harpur’s numbering and numbers added later (by Mitchell librarian?).</p>

(16 poems)<br>
Pages 1–109: date 1853–1855. [This is the numbering of the Mitchell volume not the original numbering of the printed Bushrangers.] <em>Format</em>: Material in this volume is a copy of The Bushrangers, A Play in Five Acts, and Other Poems, 1853, with pages missing and extensive alterations and additions to the poems, and with poems written on endpapers. Frontpaper (page i): annotated ‘D. S. Mitchell’ and note ‘Bought from Mrs Baldwin,Charles Harpur’s daughter.’ Page i: version of ‘Trust in God’ date 1853–1855, later than cancelled version on endpaper page 109, annotated by Mrs Harpur? ‘Charles Harpur’.</p>

Pages i–[137]. Cuttings date 1855–1862. Compiled and amended 1862–1863. Some items identified by lightbox reading from Braidwood papers (Dispatch and Independent) and others as yet unsighted. Amended version of ‘The Creek of the Graves’ (sic) on pages 39–59 may be a broadsheet from the Braidwood Dispatch about 1861–1863.
