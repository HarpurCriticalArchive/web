<h3 id="anameasaarchivalscopeofthecharlesharpurcriticalarchive"><a name=AS></a>Archival scope of the Charles Harpur Critical Archive</h3>

<p>With the few exceptions listed below, the Charles Harpur Critical
Archive (CHCA) includes archival transcriptions of all known versions of
Harpur’s poems to 1900 – from ‘The Wreck’, published in the Australian
on 20 December 1833, to the three poems published in the <em>Windsor and
Richmond Gazette</em> on 23 March 1895. One of the latter, ‘The Coming On of
Freedom’, is of particular significance because it was submitted by Mary
Harpur ‘partly in print and partly in manuscript’. Mary worked
tirelessly after Harpur’s death in 1868 to promote his poetry, including
the (unfulfilled) ambition of publication in England, until her own
death in 1899 at the age of 82. The CHCA therefore aims to include all
versions dating from the nineteenth century, noting however that poems
anthologised after Harpur’s death, such as the four poems in volume 4 of
<em>The Poets and Poetry of the Nineteenth Century</em>, edited by Alfred H.
Miles, (London, 1892), which are identical to their appearance in the
1883 Poems, do not constitute new versions; their bibliographic details
are given in the editorial notes to Poems.</p>

<p>The CHCA cannot claim to include every work or version ever composed by
Harpur. In addition to those whose whereabouts are unknown, the subtitle
of ‘Impromptu Stanzas’ in MS C376 in the Mitchell Library confirms that
some early works were destroyed: ‘Impromptu Stanzas. Addressed to a
Collection of the Author’s earliest Poems, while committing the
Manuscripts to the flames’.</p>

<h3 id="anameesaeditorialscopeofthechca"><a name=ES></a>Editorial scope of the CHCA</h3>

<p>The preparation of reading texts of all significant versions along with
textual commentary and annotation is the second phase of the CHCA
project. This editorial phase began in 2015 and will be ongoing for some
years. Publication releases will be made in tranches. The conventions
adopted for the editorial task and the silent categories of emendation
and reporting are still evolving and will be announced here in due
course.</p>

<p>To reach authoritative conclusions about the textual circumstances of
each work the editorial phase requires a collation of variant versions
in a far more detailed, character-by-character form than the less
granulated kind needed for the archival phase. The latter has been able
to reveal that versions that would once have stood between presently
extant versions have in many cases been lost. But more thorough
collation using Multi-way Compare – a tool based on the Multi-Variant
Document (MVD) format, which is being refined for the CHCA – will shed
further light on the genealogy of variants, as well as adding more
certainty to the necessarily provisional dating and thus chronological
ordering of the manuscript versions.</p>

<p>For those poems that have passed through the editorial phase, the
textual commentary provided in headnotes and editorial notes to each
version specifies, and discusses where necessary, the relationship of
versions to one another and describes Harpur’s revisional practice.</p>

<p>Technically, the collations are only another visualisation of data
already computed in the MVDs when separating the textual layers of
writing and revision in manuscripts for viewing. It is then an
additional matter of computing the variation between versions. As the
editing proceeds these collations will gradually become available to
interested users – at first, two versions at a time but, later, in
multiple versions. (For further description of the tool and the MVD
format, see Technical Design.)</p>

<h3 id="anamesourcesasources"><a name=SOURCES></a>Sources</h3>

<p>The archival transcriptions of Harpur’s poems in the CHCA, on which the
edited reading texts are based, are sourced mainly from colonial
newspapers and the substantial collection of his manuscript books in the
Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney.</p>

<p>For a physical description, a summary of the contents and the number of
versions found in each of the 24 manuscript books, see <a href="33">List of
Sources</a>. This List also gives the source of the 17 versions of
poems found in Harpur’s handwritten correspondence. Fifteen are
preserved at the Mitchell Library, one at the State Library of Victoria
and another at Trinity College, University of Melbourne.</p>

<p>The <a href="33">List of Sources</a> also enumerates the surprisingly wide range of
colonial newspapers and journals in which Harpur’s poetry appeared.
Nearly 50 in number, concentrated in Sydney and the New South Wales
country areas, they extended as far afield as Melbourne, Portland in
country Victoria and Adelaide, places Harpur never visited. The number
of newspapers would have been swelled by the 24 poems present in
unidentified newspaper cuttings in the manuscript books in the Mitchell,
and also probably by printings and reprintings in other newspapers that
have escaped attention so far.</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="33">List of Sources</a> gives bibliographic details of the
pamphlets and books published under Harpur’s name to 1900 and of the
appearances of his poems in anthologies until 1900. In each case, the
shelfmark in the holding library of the particular copy from which the
transcriptions were taken is given. Later anthology appearances (most of
which fall outside the CHCA’s cut-off date of 1900) are provided in the
separate <a href="34">List of Poems in Anthologies to 2004</a> <a href="#FN1">(1)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="anamepatapreparationofthearchivaltranscriptions"><a name=PAT></a>Preparation of the archival transcriptions</h3>

<p>Initial draft transcriptions of the Harpur manuscript books in the
Mitchell Library were prepared by the School of Cultural Records,
Jadavpur University, Kolkata. These XML files were then checked and
coded by CHCA digital archivist Meredith Sherlock, who also prepared
transcriptions of all the published sources and all the poems contained
in correspondence.</p>

<p>Checked transcriptions of all the available versions are included in the
CHCA, with only a few exceptions (owing to resource constraints), as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘The Temple of Infamy’ in MS A87&#8211;1, pp. 353–[380]</li>
<li>MS B78, pp. 1–156 and [second pagination] i–iv, containing draft versions of ‘Genius Lost’</li>
<li>MS C377, pp. i, 1–134, which contains only a version of ‘The Kangaroo Hunt’ and its great many notes</li>
<li>the play ‘King Saul’ in MS A87&#8211;2, pp. 559–98</li>
<li>the play <em>The Bushrangers</em> in all its published and manuscript versions <a href="#FN2">(2)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Work on A96 is ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>where a manuscript version is difficult to transcribe</strong> because of
illegibility or the unusual complexity of its revisions, an unchecked
transcription derived from the Kolkata XML files has been uploaded as an
interim measure. There are currently 35 of these. Images of and metadata
for all the versions for which there is no transcription, or only an
unchecked one, are nonetheless available in the CHCA.</p>

<p><strong>totals</strong>: There are 686 works in the CHCA in 2,704 versions. The
terminal year for the count is 1900. Of the 2,704 versions, 1,573 are in
manuscript (mostly Harpur autographs, with a few in Mary Harpur or their
son Washington Harpur’s hand), 677 in extant newspapers or magazines,
111 in non-extant newspapers with the versions surviving only as
cuttings, 185 in Harpur’s pamphlet, broadsheet and book publications,
117 as cuttings of newspapers or published sources with holograph
revisions, 19 in correspondence and 19 in published anthologies.</p>

<h3 id="anamedpwvadesignationofpoeticworksandversions"><a name=DPWV></a>Designation of poetic works and versions</h3>

<p>Before the draft transcriptions of the manuscript books could be checked
for accuracy and divided into appropriate units some basic decisions
needed to be made about the organisation and designation of their
contents for the CHCA. Here, the limitations of Holt and Perkins’s
<em>Finding List</em> soon became evident. <a href="#FN3">(3)</a> While it originally
served as an invaluable resource, its design features were ill-suited to
an online environment. A number of errors were also identified.</p>

<p>The <em>Finding List</em> information was therefore reworked into spreadsheet
fields before the CHCA could be populated with files and metadata. As
the division and checking of the draft transcriptions proceeded the
spreadsheet served as an organising convenience.</p>

<p>The two resources are quite different in their intellectual design. A
detailed list of the <a href="40">structural re-workings</a> has been maintained
for reference, and the <a href="41">spreadsheet</a> will become available here in
due course.</p>

<p>The main implications are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each work in the CHCA has been assigned a unique numeric identifier
(e.g. H001), and then each version of that work has been given its own
associated alphabetic suffix (H001a, H001b etc.). The alphabetical order
of the version identifiers is loosely chronological, based on their
original order in the <em>Finding List</em>; but, as discoveries were made
during the CHCA project, the deletion and addition of versions rendered
their alphabetical ordering unreliable as a chronological indicator.
Similarly, the numerical identifiers derive from their position in the
printed <em>Finding List</em>, which presented them in alphabetical order by
title, a positioning of no relevance in a digital environment that
requires unique not sequential identifiers. Thus the fact that some H
numbers were dispensed with once duplicates in the Finding List were
identified, and that some version identifiers have similarly been
deleted or added, is of no consequence in the CHCA.</li>
<li>In his later years, Harpur reworked many of his poems into series or
sequences. Deciding whether to classify a poem as a work in its own
right or only as part of a larger work in the CHCA therefore became
necessary. The <em>Finding List’s</em> decision to adopt as the filing title
‘the latest version transcribed or published in Harpur’s lifetime’ (p.
xxi) resulted in many of the poems being listed under their series
title, sometimes with a duplicate entry for earlier versions (e.g. ‘Love
in the Past’). In contrast, the CHCA privileges the ‘stand-alone’
version, and only uses a series/sequence title as the work title when
one or more of the poems in that series/sequence have no stand-alone
version (and sometimes no other title) and seem to have been conceived
as part of the series/sequence from the outset. These are ‘Autumnal
Leaves’ (numbered 1–6), ‘The Beautiful’ (I–IX), ‘Love the Idealiser’
(1–4), ‘A Lyrical Love Story’ (1:1– 3:5), ‘Records of a Poet’s Love’
(I–XXXIVb + Epilogue), ‘Rhymed Criticisms’ (I–XVI), ‘Similes from Homer’
(I–X) and ‘Sonnets Dedicated to Australian Senators’ (I–XVII). All of
the individual works in these series/sequences have unique (albeit
consecutive) H numbers. In addition, the series filing titles ‘Monodies
I’ and ‘Monodies II’ have been retained to differentiate two poems that
are both named ‘Obituary Lines’.</li>
<li>In contrast, a few poems have been deemed to be one work (and thus
with a single title) but in several parts: ‘The Famous Night Scene in
the VIII Iliad I–IV’ (H127-A, H127-B, H127-C, H127-D), ‘Genius Lost’
(H151-A to H151-W), and ‘A Supernaturalised Battle-Piece I–III’ (H575-A,
H575-B, H575-C), ‘The Beautiful I’ (H035) and ‘IA’ (H035-A), ‘The
Beautiful II’ (H036) and ‘IIA’ (H036-A), ‘Rhymed Criticisms III. Milton:
His Poetical Style’ (H463-A) and ‘His Minor Poems’ (H463-B), the 3 parts
of ‘Rhymed Criticisms VI. Pope’ (H466-A, B and C) and the 4 parts of
‘XIII Coleridge’ (H473-A, B, C, D).</li>
<li>There are some works with the same title, and these are distinguished
by an editorially supplied number after the title in parentheses:
‘Morning (1)’ and ‘(2)’, ‘A Regret (1)’ and ‘(2)’, ‘Song (1)’, ‘(2)’,
‘(3)’, ‘(4)’ and ‘(5)’, ‘Sonnet (1)’ and ‘(2)’, ‘Stanzas (1)’ and ‘(2)’,
‘To Mary (1)’ and ‘(2)’, ‘Why? (1)’ and ‘(2)’ and finally ‘Fragment
(1)’, ‘(2)’, ‘(3)’, ‘(6)’ and ‘(8)’ [the others called ‘Fragment’ were
identified as in fact being parts of other poems].</li>
<li>The <em>Finding List’s</em> organisation of the parts of ‘The Famous Night
Scene’, ‘A Supernaturalised Battle-Piece’ and ‘The Tower of the Dream’
has been substantially modified.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the designations of works and versions in the CHCA supersede
those of the Finding List but of course, like any other editorial
interpretation, remain open to argument.</p>

<h3 id="anamehnvtaharpur’snotesversionsandtitles"><a name=HNVT></a>Harpur’s notes, versions and titles</h3>

<p>In the CHCA, authorial notes that accompany poems are treated as
integral parts of the work. Harpur’s notes are often lengthy, with the
result that the CHCA contains at least as much Harpur prose as it does
verse. Nonetheless, notes to a poem are not included if the poem itself
is not present.</p>

<p>Thus a number of manuscripts, MS C382 in particular, contain prose
notes, mostly in draft form, whose titles identify them with a
particular poem; but Harpur has not indicated they were to be attached.
They are interpreted as having been rejected or left aside for re-use,
perhaps for some later version that never materialised. These notes may
be referenced in the editorial notes to those poems, with links to their
images, but have not been transcribed. In summary, all versions
identified with an alphanumeric identifier contain Harpur’s verse, but
they may contain prose notes as well.</p>

<p><strong>metadata provided for the transcription of each version</strong> appears as a
headnote above the poem. It includes complete source information, date
of composition or publication (definite or provisional), series or
sequence (if applicable), number of lines of the poem, notes by the
newspaper or anthology editor if present, the number of the major
manuscript or other major collection the version belonged to (if any).
The edited reading texts provide similar categories of information but
it is further digested and accompanied by textual commentary and
annotation of biblical, literary, historical and other allusions,
including parallels with other works by Harpur. The editorial work is
ongoing.</p>

<p>HarpurxE2x80x99s extant correspondence is summarised item by item, and extracts
are transcribed, in the Timeline section of the CHCA.</p>

<p>The transcription of <strong>poems in harpur correspondence</strong> may include the
whole letter if it is short, otherwise enough of the text is provided to
give the poem context. Other ‘embedded’ poems are those quoted in full
in a note to another poem. Each embedded version has its own
alphanumeric identifier, but the reader will be directed to the note
where the embedded poem is found rather than see it presented out of
context. The programming for this feature, which avoids duplication of
the material, is still under construction.</p>

<p>Poetic compositions include the two verse dramas ‘Death of an Editor’
and ‘The Death of Shylock’, and also the plays <em>The Bushrangers</em> in its
various forms and ‘King Saul’. Resource constraints have meant the
latter two plays could not be included. Also not included are Harpur’s
only known short story ‘The Importance of a Rhyme. A Story of the Old
Dock-Yard’ (published in the <em>Weekly Register</em> on 30 August 1845, also a
cutting in A92) and numerous <strong>prose pieces</strong> in his manuscripts or in
newspapers.</p>

<p><strong>deciding what constitutes a version</strong> (and therefore a work) is not a
straightforward matter. The series/sequence problem has been discussed
above. As Harpur continued to rework his poems throughout his life,
often substantially, a heavily revised poem might become virtually a new
work, and thus be better classified as such, rather than as another
version of the same work. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>Finding List’s</em> first three versions of ‘The Temple of Infamy’
(each is 34 lines in length) have been re-categorised as versions of a
separate work titled ‘Wentworth’ to which they closely relate, as these
lines were very much altered for their later inclusion in the much
longer ‘Temple’ of c. 500 lines.</li>
<li>In the case of ‘Wordsworth’s Poetry’ the work designation is
problematic: in MS A95 the first reading ‘How much, my Nora, in this
world—how much’ (as untitled ‘XXV’ in the series ‘Records of a Poet’s
Love’) was changed by Harpur to read ‘How much, O Wordsworth, in this
world—how much’, thus repurposing the poem via a radical change of
subject (p. 15). The first reading was not further transcribed, but the
second is found in the later MS A87&#8211;1. In this unique instance the two
states of the same transcription have been classed as versions of two
different works.</li>
<li>Again, ‘The Complaint’ (listed under ‘Petrarchian Musings’ in the
<em>Finding List</em>) is an early version of ‘Records of a Poet’s Love X’, but
the two have been deemed distinct enough to warrant separate work
identifiers. Similarly with ‘Delia’ and ‘Records of a Poet’s Love XVI’.</li>
<li>On the other hand, stanzas 2, 3 and 4 of ‘The Hunter’s Indian Dove’
are drawn from the earlier ‘My Sable Fair’. Thus these two <em>Finding
List</em> entries are now treated as the same work, as are ‘Educational
Mottoes’ and ‘A School Motto’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some <strong>fragments</strong> have been designated versions in their own right,
while others have not, unavoidably on a case-by-case basis. Thus in MS
B78, the 8-line fragment of ‘The “Nevers” of Poetry’ has been deemed a
version of a work, while the fragments in C380 are simply recorded in
the editorial note to the complete version of the poem in that source.
The justification for each decision may be found in the editorial
commentary.</p>

<p><strong>work titles</strong> are generally those of the majority of versions of the
work in question, although they have occasionally been edited for
reasons of brevity, simplicity or consistency. This arrangement differs
from that in the <em>Finding List</em>, which, as noted above, used the title
of ‘the latest version transcribed or published in Harpur’s lifetime’.
Where no title exists for a particular version, the majority title
adopted by the CHCA is given in square brackets. Where a work surviving
as a single version is untitled, the first line of the poem is adopted
as the work title.</p>

<p><strong>version titles</strong> that differ from the work title in the CHCA will be
added to the titles list, with links to enable cross-referencing. A
title deleted in a manuscript and replaced with another is not included
unless it also occurs in another source. Finally, it cannot be assumed
that newspaper titles are necessarily authorial.</p>

<h3 id="anamevudamaversionsunlocateddeletedaddedormissing"><a name=VUDAM></a>Versions unlocated, deleted, added or missing</h3>

<p>A few of the versions in the <em>Finding List</em> could not be located and
have been deleted from the CHCA. ‘The Pirates’, ‘The Robbers’ and ‘The
Sea Captain’ were acknowledged as received by the <em>Sydney Times</em> on 23
September 1834, but no such published versions have been sighted. ‘The
Anchor’ was sent by Harpur to Henry Parkes in a letter of 4 March 1855,
but it has not survived. ‘To William Wordsworth’ (in C376, p. 594) is
not a version, but a scrap from Harpur’s pamphlet Thoughts: A Series of
Sonnets (1845): Harpur used it to write on the blank verso.</p>

<p>Authorial revision in holograph on a newspaper cutting creates a new
version; but <strong>unamended newspaper cuttings</strong> are not classified as
versions separate from their original newspaper appearance since,
textually, they are the same thing. This is a significant departure from
the conventions of the <em>Finding List</em>; in this way, 106 versions have
been removed from consideration. The existence of each cutting has,
however, been recorded in an editorial note to the newspaper version
itself. The term ‘unamended’ has been interpreted to include those
situations where holograph corrections (rather than revisions) only
repair an obvious non-authorial typographical error in the printed
version. Again, this information will be found in the editorial note to
the newspaper version of the poem.</p>

<p>With the benefit of <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au">TROVE</a> and other online
resources, the CHCA was also able to add 46 versions that were either
inadvertently omitted from the <em>Finding List</em> or not known to its
compilers. Further scanning of colonial newspapers for TROVE in the
future may reveal more, but no new Harpur works have been discovered.</p>

<p>A small number of <strong>versions for which no transcription or image is
currently available</strong> remain in the CHCA. They are retained as
placeholders in the hope that publication of the CHCA will help to bring
them to light. They include five of the six poems in <em>Songs of
Australia</em>, described in Biographical Sketch. Of the six, ‘Mary of
Eulengo’ is legible as a cutting in MS C381, but the other poems survive
only on tear sheets pasted text-down in MS A92 with holograph poems
written on the blank versos. Horizontal rotation of the images allows
the poems to be identified and transcribed.</p>

<p><strong>other anomalies</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A placeholder for a version of the ‘Prelude’ from ‘Genius Lost’,
unsighted by the Finding List compilers but perhaps known to them in an
unidentified secondary source, is included. Its unique first line is
strong evidence of its existence, though a search on TROVE has failed to
find the lines in the Sydney Chronicle (its likely but queried source,
according to the compilers) or any other paper of the period.</li>
<li>‘A Harpur Discovery’ in <em>Southerly</em> 5 (1944) presents a holograph
version of the sonnet ‘To Doctor Lang’ in a copy of Harpur’s <em>The
Bushrangers</em> submitted by an anonymous contributor. The CHCA includes
the transcription from <em>Southerly</em>, but no image of the original
manuscript is available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the <em>Finding List’s</em> version of ‘Epitaph on a Sailor’ given as
published in the Empire of 6 June 1857 has not been found. Its first
line matches that in the <em>Braidwood Dispatch</em> of 1861, but the entry
cannot be simply dismissed as a <em>Finding List</em> error. This version is
also retained as a placeholder.</p>

<h3 id="anameepaeditorialpolicy"><a name=EP></a>Editorial policy</h3>

<p>The texts are edited at the level of the version rather than the work.
This gives the reader access to edited versions of different works
written at roughly the same time, a significant matter in Harpur’s case.
The reader may also compare changes manifested in the successive
versions of a single work across biographical periods. Both avenues will
be of assistance to readers wanting to observe the unfolding of Harpur’s
<em>oeuvre</em>.</p>

<p>Thus chronology rather than the traditional aim of final intentions has
been preferred as the principle of editorial organisation. The latter
principle, had it been preferred, would have encountered considerable
practical difficulties, themselves a reflection of Harpur’s working
methods and the confusing arrangement of his manuscript books in the
Mitchell Library.</p>

<h4 id="anametmsathe‘majormanuscripts’"><a name=TMS></a>The ‘Major Manuscripts’</h4>

<p>During 1867–68 Harpur transcribed and revised eleven collections, and
his son Washington copied out a twelfth after his father’s death. They
were subsequently bound together, without respecting their numbering and
are preserved, along with other handwritten versions and fragments,
within the Harpur manuscript books in the Mitchell Library. Of these
so-called ‘Major Manuscripts’ Elizabeth Perkins concluded in 2002:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The poems were written specifically for an English edition [which never
eventuated]. They are not necessarily the versions or the poems he may have
preferred to include in a representative collection of his work. They exclude some
of Harpur’s longer poems and include only some sonnets from the sequence ‘Records
of a Poet’s Love’. The twelve collections, however, constitute the last-known
version of about half his poems. (<em>Finding List</em>, p. 220)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A printed edition organised around final-intention principles might well
choose these versions as the basis of its reading texts. But that would
leave about half the poems without obvious contenders for selection and
with distinctly different early versions unrepresented except in textual
apparatus.</p>

<p>There are two traditional ways of seeking clarification when attempting
to resolve the vexed question of textual authority. One way, which has
proved impossible to date, is to reconstruct the series of events that
would explain the present internal arrangement of the manuscript books,
which contain the Major Manuscripts and other materials: those acts of
copying, collection, ordering and re-ordering by Harpur before his death
in 1868, afterwards by his well-meaning family as they sought
publication, and subsequently by David Mitchell who bought the
collection from Mrs Harpur probably in the late 1890s (<em>Finding List</em>,
p. xii). There are plenty of codicological clues: the manuscripts are a
mixture of home binding, professional binding and subsequent Mitchell
Library binding, on paper of varying sizes and multiple, conflicting
paginations, and often with bound-in estrays. But the evidence is too
profuse and confusing to yield a decisive clarification.</p>

<p>The other traditional way of establishing a series of events is textual
in orientation rather than documentary: that is, to transcribe and
collate all versions of the poems in the manuscript books against one
another and against all their printed counterparts, particularly in the
newspapers of the day. This task has proved possible. It has helped
establish or confirm textual relationships among versions and thus, to
some extent, the status or witness of the carrying documents. This
textual enquiry has gradually clarified, according to the circumstances
of each work, a chronology of composition, revision, early publication,
transcription and subsequent revision for later, actual or intended
publication. Inevitably, implications for understanding the manuscript
books as documentary collections arise from this textual analysis. They
are explored in the textual commentary to the individual versions, and
it well may be that a clearer picture than has emerged during the
archival phase will prove possible as the editing proceeds.</p>

<p>The CHCA takes advantage of its digital medium and provides all
versions, enabling the reader to consult, if desired, the versions
intended for the English edition but equally also their earlier
versions, as well as all versions of the other poetic works. The
final-intentions question does not therefore trip up the editorial
effort. <a href="#FN4">(4)</a></p>

collections are no longer extant in the Harpur manuscript books at the

prepared for the 1883 <em>Poems</em>.</p>
