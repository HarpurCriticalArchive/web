The CHCA is a digital archive *and* a 
scholarly edition of the poetic works of Charles Harpur (1813-68), the 
most important poet of colonial New South Wales. A Romantic celebrator 
of Australian landscape, a political satirist, a love poet and early 
environmentalist, Harpur and his works remain relevant today. But they 
are not easily accessible. 

This is because Harpur was a prolific poet and an inveterate reviser. 
Extant today in manuscript, and in colonial newspaper and other printed 
forms, are over 2,700 versions of his 686 works in verse, as well as the 
often fascinating prose notes that he wrote for them. Most of these 
versions have never been published - until now.

Use the Browse menu to start exploring the poems, but it is a good idea to read the brief 
[Overview of the CHCA](node/31) first, or the much fuller Introduction below.
