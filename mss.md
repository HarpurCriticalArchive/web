![A96](/images/about/A96.jpg)
(66 poems)<br>
Pages 1–74: date 1867. The volume is in Washington Harpur’s writing and transcription is not always reliable. (Washington was aged sixteen in 1867). A96 comprises chiefly ‘Poems in Early Life.’ Some poems extant only from 1850s. Transcription of these poems is sometimes from a very early version and A96 is not a reliable guide for date changes in other versions. [Salier in MS B994 (1946) suggests A96 is ‘a rewritten version of poems, compiled between Feb. 1860 and September 1863, and altered slightly about March 1865.’] However a more likely date for this rewriting is 1867. *Format*: Foolscap notebook with pale blue paper of 36 lines.

#### [A97](http://www.acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=421910#tabs-1) [[VIEW](/harpur/msviewer?docid=english/harpur/A97)]

Bound collection of pages compiled from seven gatherings stitched together. Letter to Mitchell Library, dated 1932, enclosing Harpur’s poem ‘Wellington’, as endpaper. Some pages are double numbered with Harpur’s numbering and numbers added later (by Mitchell librarian?). The original binding positioned pages 307-310 incorrectly, but they are represented here in their correct positions, after page 282.

(16 poems)<br>
Pages 1–109: date 1853–1855. [This is the numbering of the Mitchell volume not the original numbering of the printed Bushrangers.] *Format*: Material in this volume is a copy of The Bushrangers, A Play in Five Acts, and Other Poems, 1853, with pages missing and extensive alterations and additions to the poems, and with poems written on endpapers. Frontpaper (page i): annotated ‘D. S. Mitchell’ and note ‘Bought from Mrs Baldwin,Charles Harpur’s daughter.’ Page i: version of ‘Trust in God’ date 1853–1855, later than cancelled version on endpaper page 109, annotated by Mrs Harpur? ‘Charles Harpur’.

(Notes on Harpur's poems)<br>
Pages i-iii, 1–69: This volume, long associated with the Harpur manuscripts, was written by C.W. Salier in 1945-1946. The format is a bound volume of typewriter paper written on the rectos only. It lists the contents of the manuscript volumes, and contains a useful timeline on the publication of the 1883 POEMS. Salier develops the theory that the composition of the 1883 book of POEMS edited by Henry M. Martin ('M') and an unknown literary advisor, was based on a series of 20 volumes by Harpur and currently bound as parts of A87, A92, A96 and A97. Salier concludes that, due to inexplicable changes from the MS versions, much of the POEMS probably contains 'an unusually high proportion of matter that is not genuine Harpur'.
