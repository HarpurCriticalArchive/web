## Overview

The Charles Harpur Critical Archive (CHCA) is a digital archive and a 
scholarly edition of the poetic works of Charles Harpur (1813–68).

### The editorial challenge

Harpur’s verse has been a fairly steady presence in the Australian 
cultural scene. However, the efforts of the interventionist early editor 
of his posthumous collection *Poems* (1883) were perpetuated in later 
selections and anthologisings. The resulting misrepresentation of his 
achievement was not recognised until the 1940s. Efforts were 
subsequently made to bring the whole body of his poetic work under 
editorial control but these either failed completely or involved 
compromises that deprived readers of the full picture.

In part, this was because Harpur was a habitual reviser, and because the papers he left behind at his death 
fell into a confusing state over the following decades, as his widow Mary Harpur 
sought to secure his legacy. The majority of the 2,700 versions 
of his 686 works in verse, together with the notes he wrote for them, have never been published.

### Archival and editorial policy

To address this situation the CHCA archives the basic materials for an 
edition (images and diplomatic transcriptions of the original documents, 
both handwritten and printed) and provides edited reading texts, 
together with textual commentary and explanatory notation. At first 
release in March 2016, the archival responsibility has been 
discharged. The editing is ongoing.

The texts are presented, whether in transcription or as edited, at the level of the *version* rather than the 
*work*. 

Via the Browse menu the reader chooses a poem. An archival transcription or edited reading text appears next to an image of the original document. The reader can change the version via a menu at the top. Invoking the Multiway Compare Tool allows the reader to compare changes in the 
successive versions of the same work across biographical periods. In addition, the Timeline of 'compositions' allows the reader to identify versions of poems written at roughly the same time and then to choose them, one at a time, via the Browse menu.

A facility 
for collaborative contributions to the CHCA by its users is planned. 

### Timelines

Entries on a biographical Timeline present the main events in Harpur’s 
life and milieu. This in turn generates the (separate) Biography, a 
series of biographical notes in readable prose, organised year-by-year. 
It amplifies events captured more briefly in the biographical Timeline 
and provides extra information and materials, including contemporary and 
historical photographs, links to images of relevant colonial-newspaper 
sources available online, and citations. Another Timeline summarises the 
subject matter of each item of Harpur’s surviving correspondence, and a 
third records the date (exact or approximate) of all his poetic 
compositions and publications, including those that appeared in colonial 
newspapers.

### Exclusions

The CHCA does not include Harpur’s plays (*The Bushrangers* and ‘King 
Saul’), nor his prose pieces written separately from his poems, although 
the technical design of the CHCA will allow them to be incorporated by 
collaborating scholars in the future. Nevertheless, all of the often 
extensive notes he wrote to accompany the poems are included. As a 
result, the CHCA presents rather more Harpur prose (most of it for the 
first time) than it does verse. The CHCA takes 1900 as its terminal 
date.
